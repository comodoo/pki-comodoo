# Use the private key to create a certificate signing request (CSR). The CSR
# details donâ€™t need to match the intermediate CA. For server certificates, the
# Common Name must be a fully qualified domain name (eg, www.example.com),
# whereas for client certificates it can be any unique identifier (eg, an
# e-mail address). Note that the Common Name cannot be the same as either your
# root or intermediate certificate.
